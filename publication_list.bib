    title={Progressive Smoothing for Motion Planning in Real-Time NMPC},
    abstract={Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a popular strategy for solving motion planning problems appearing in autonomous driving applications that include collision avoidance constraints. Non-smooth obstacle shapes, such as rectangles, introduce additional local minima in the underlying optimization problem. Using smooth over-approximations, e.g., ellipsoidal shapes, limits the performance due to their conservativeness. We propose to vary the smoothness and the related over-approximation by a homotopy. Instead of varying the smoothness in consecutive sequential quadratic programming iterations, we use formulations that decrease the smooth over-approximation from the end towards the beginning of the prediction horizon. Thus, the real-time iteration scheme applies to the proposed NMPC formulation, i.e., only one quadratic program needs to be solved at each time step. Different formulations are compared in simulation experiments and shown to successfully improve performance without increasing the computational burden.},

	abstract = {Mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) are a versatile way of formulating vehicle decision making and motion planning problems, where the prediction model is a hybrid dynamical system that involves both discrete and continuous decision variables. However, even the most advanced MIQP solvers can hardly account for the challenging requirements of automotive embedded platforms. Thus, we use machine learning to simplify and hence speed up optimization. Our work builds on recent ideas for solving MIQPs in real-time by training a neural network to predict the optimal values of integer variables and solving the remaining problem by online quadratic programming. Specifically, we propose a recurrent permutation equivariant deep set that is particularly suited for imitating MIQPs that involve many obstacles, which is often the major source of computational burden in motion planning problems. Our framework comprises also a feasibility projector that corrects infeasible predictions of integer variables and considerably increases the likelihood of computing a collision-free trajectory. We evaluate the performance, safety and real-time feasibility of decision-making for autonomous driving using the proposed approach on realistic multi-lane traffic scenarios with interactive agents in SUMO simulations.},

A novel motion planning algorithm that can capture long-horizon dependencies as well as short-horizon dynamics is presented. Pivotal to our approach is a geometric approximation of the long-horizon combinatorial transition problem which we formulate in the continuous time-space domain. Moreover, a discrete-time formulation of a short-horizon optimal motion planning problem is formulated and combined with the long-horizon planner. Both individual problems, as well as their combination, are formulated as mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) and solved in real-time by using state-of-the-art solvers. We show how the presented algorithm outperforms two other state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms in closed-loop performance and computation time in lane changing problems. Evaluations are performed using the traffic simulator SUMO, a custom low-level tracking model predictive controller, and high-fidelity vehicle models and scenarios, provided by the CommonRoad environment.},

In order to formulate the nonlinear model predictive control problem, different coordinate systems can be used with different advantages. We propose and compare formulations for the nonlinear MPC related optimization problem, involving a Cartesian and a Frenet coordinate frame in a single nonlinear program. We specify costs and collision avoidance constraints in the more advantageous coordinate frame, derive appropriate formulations and compare different obstacle constraints. With this approach, we exploit the simpler formulation of opponent vehicle constraints in the Cartesian coordinate frame, as well as road-aligned costs and constraints related to the Frenet coordinate frame. Comparisons to other approaches in a simulation framework highlight the advantages of the proposed methods.},

A high-level policy, represented as a neural network, outputs a reward specification that is used within the function of a parametric nonlinear model predictive controller. By including constraints and vehicle kinematics in the nonlinear program, we can guarantee safe and feasible trajectories related to the used model. Compared to classical reinforcement learning, our approach restricts the exploration to safe trajectories, starts with an excellent prior performance and yields complete trajectories that can be passed to a tracking lowest-level controller. We do not address the lowest-level controller in this work and assume perfect tracking of feasible trajectories. We show the superior performance of our algorithm on simulated racing tasks that include high-level decision-making. The vehicle learns to efficiently overtake slower vehicles and avoids getting overtaken by blocking faster ones.},

We assume that the observed trajectory is the result of an optimization problem that trades off path progress against acceleration and jerk smoothness, and which is restricted by constraints. The algorithm predicts a trajectory by solving a parameterized nonlinear program (NLP) which contains path progress and smoothness in cost terms. By observing the actual motion of a vehicle, the parameters of prediction are updated by means of solving an inverse optimal control problem that contains the parameters of the predicting NLP as optimization variables. The algorithm therefore learns to predict the observed vehicle trajectory in a least-squares relation to measurement data and to the presumed structure of the predicting NLP. This work contributes with an algorithm that allows for accurate and interpretable predictions with sparse data. The algorithm is implemented on embedded hardware in an autonomous real-world race car that is competing in the challenge Roborace and analyzed with respect to recorded data.},

This paper proposes an optimization-based parameterization approach to establish an alternative transformation curve which yields favorable numerical properties for the consecutive use of numerical optimization approaches such as MPC. The optimization objective minimizes the change of curvature and pushes the evolute (i.e. singular region) of the transformation curve outside the feasible region. The convergence improvement of the proposed parameterization approach in terms of integrator precision, optimization time and iteration counts is compared in simulation examples, using a time-optimal nonlinear optimization formulation.},

	abstract = {Trajectory planning with the consideration of obstacles is a classical task in autonomous driving and robotics applications. This paper introduces a novel solution approach for the subclass of autonomous racing problems which is additionally capable of dealing with reward objects. This special type of objects is representing particular regions in state space, whose optional reaching is somehow beneficial (e.g. results in bonus points during a race). First, a homotopy class is selected which represents the left/right and catch/ignore decisions related to obstacle avoidance and reward collection, respectively. For this purpose, a linear mixed-integer problem is posed such that an approximated combinatorial problem is solved and repetitive switching decisions between solver calls are avoided. Secondly, an optimal control problem (OCP) based on a single-track vehicle model is solved within this homotopy class. In the corresponding nonlinear program, homotopy iterations are performed on the race track boundaries which correspond to the previously chosen homotopy class. This leads to an improved convergence of the solver compared to the direct approach. The mixed-integer method’s effectiveness is demonstrated within a real-world test scenario during the autonomous racing competition Roborace. Furthermore, its combination with the OCP as well as the performance gain resulting from the homotopy iterations are shown in simulation.},
